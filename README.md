# 👋 Introduction  
Hey! My name is **daannzy**, and I'm an independent developer passionate about technology, mobile apps, and everything that involves logic, creativity, and challenge.

Currently, I lead a small indie initiative where I create, modify, and publish Android applications. I'm also the organizer of a local **osu!droid** community, contributing with translations, support, and quality content for friends.

## 💼 Role  
**Solo developer** and **manager of my own projects**.

I focus on Android app development, app translations, and improvements based on community feedback.  
I'm also responsible for a local osu!droid group where I share updates, tips, and help the community grow.

## 🧠 Skills  
Technologies and tools I use regularly:

- 🧩 **Java (beginner level)**  
- 🖌️ **XML for Android UI layouts**  
- 🗃️ **Basic GitHub** (repositories, commits, organization)  
- 📱 **Mobile tools** (APK Editor, translators, compilers)

**Areas I enjoy the most:**

- Android development  
- App translation and customization  
- APK creation and editing  
- Logic and strategy (chess included ♟️)

I'm driven by curiosity and learning. I love experimenting, testing, and understanding how things work behind the scenes.

## 📂 Projects  
Most of my projects include:

- Simple Android apps  
- Translated or customized applications  
- Android modded APKs

I run a **WhatsApp community** where I post translated APKs, project updates, and news — especially focused on osu!droid and Android customization fans.

My goal is to grow as an **indie developer**, expand my skills, and eventually launch full-featured, original apps.
