# Introduction  
Hey! My name is **Daniel**, and I’m an independent male developer passionate about technology, mobile apps, and everything that involves logic, creativity, and challenge.

I currently lead a small indie initiative where I create, modify, and publish Android apps. I’m also the founder of a local **osu!droid** community, where I help with translations, tech support, and share content with friends.

---

## Role  
**Solo developer** and **manager of my own projects**.

I focus on Android app development, translating and customizing apps, and making improvements based on community feedback.  
I also run a local osu!droid group, always aiming to bring helpful content to the community.

## Skills  
Here are the technologies and tools I work with:

-  **Java (beginner level)**  
-  **XML for Android UI layouts**  
-  **Basic GitHub** (repos, commits, versioning)  
- **Mobile tools** (APK Editor, translators, compilers)

**Areas I’m most interested in:**

- Android development  
- App translation and customization  
- APK creation and modding  
- Logic and strategy (including chess ♟️)

I'm curious and love to learn, test, and understand how things work behind the scenes.

## Projects  
Most of my work includes:

- Simple Android apps  
- Translated or modded apps  
- Custom APKs

I also manage a **WhatsApp community** where I share translated APKs, updates, and news — mainly for osu!droid fans and Android mod lovers.

My goal is to grow as an **indie developer**, improve my skills, and eventually launch full-featured apps.
