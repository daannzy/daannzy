#  Introduction  
Hey! I'm **daannzy**, an independent developer passionate about technology, mobile apps, and everything that involves logic, creativity, and challenge.

Right now, I lead a small indie initiative where I create, customize, and publish Android apps. I'm also the founder of a local **osu!droid** community, where I help with translations, tech support, and share content with friends.

## 💼 Role  
**Solo developer** and **manager of my own projects**.

I work on Android app development, translate and customize apps, and apply improvements based on community feedback.  
I'm also in charge of a local osu!droid group, always looking to collaborate and bring useful content to the table.

## 🧠 Skills  
Technologies and tools I use on a daily basis:

-  **Java (beginner level)**  
-  **XML for Android UI layouts**  
-  **Basic GitHub** (repos, commits, versioning)  
-  **Mobile tools** (APK Editor, translators, compilers)

**What I enjoy the most:**

- Android development  
- App translation and customization  
- APK creation and modding  
- Logic and strategy (including chess ♟️)

I’m all about exploring, testing, and understanding how things work behind the scenes.

## 📂 Projects  
Most of my projects involve:

- Simple Android apps  
- Translated or modified apps  
- Modded APKs for Android

I run a **WhatsApp community** where I post updates, translated APKs, and news — mainly for osu!droid fans and people who enjoy Android custom tools.

My goal is to keep leveling up as an **indie dev**, sharpen my skills, and one day release full-featured, original apps.
